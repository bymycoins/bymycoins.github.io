How to use the iconfont
--------------------------------------------

STEP 1
Copy the font-files (.ttf, .eot, .svg and .woff) into your project folder.

STEP 2
Add the font CSS file (androidicons.css) to your HTML document or import it to your exsiting CSS file.

STEP 3
Use CSS-classes, Unicodes or HTML-Entities to display the icons. Style them with CSS (font-size, color, etc.).

Comments on archive content
--------------------------------------------

- /font/* - fonts in different formats

- /css/*  - different kinds of css, for all situations. Should be ok with twitter bootstrap. Also, you can skip <i> style and assign icon classes directly to text elements, if you don't mind about IE7.

- demo.html - demo file, to show your webfont content

- LICENSE.txt - license info about source fonts, used to build your one.

- config.json - keeps your settings. You can import it back to fontello anytime, to continue your work


Why so many CSS files ?
-----------------------

Because we like to fit all your needs :)

- basic file, <your_font_name>.css - is usually enougth, in contains @font-face and character codes definition

- *-ie7.css - if you need IE7 support, but still don't wish to put char codes directly into html

- *-codes.css and *-ie7-codes.css - if you like to use your own @font-face rules, but still wish to benefit of css generation. That can be very convenient for automated assets build systems. When you need to update font - no needs to manually edit files, just override old version with archive content. See fontello source codes for example.

- *-embedded.css - basic css file, but with embedded WOFF font, to avoid CORS issues in Firefox and IE9+, when fonts are hosted on the separate domain. We strongly recommend to resolve this issue by `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` server headers. But if you ok with dirty hack - this file is for you. Note, that data url moved to separate @font-face to avoid problems with <IE9, when string is too long.

- animate.css - use it to get ideas about spinner rotation animation.


Attention for server setup
--------------------------------------------

You MUST setup server to reply with proper `mime-types` for font files. In other case, some browsers will fail to show fonts.

Usually, `apache` already has necessary settings, but `nginx` and other webservers should be tuned. Here is list of mime types for our file extentions:

- `application/vnd.ms-fontobject` - eot
- `application/x-font-woff` - woff
- `application/x-font-ttf` - ttf
- `image/svg+xml` - svg
